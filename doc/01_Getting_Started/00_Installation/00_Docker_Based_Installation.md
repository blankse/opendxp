# Docker-Based Installation

You can use Docker to set up a new OpenDXP Installation.
You don't need to have a PHP environment with composer installed.

### Prerequisites

* Your user must be allowed to run docker commands (directly or via sudo).
* You must have docker compose installed.
* Your user must be allowed to change file permissions (directly or via sudo).

### Follow These Steps

1. Create skeleton project via composer

```bash 
# empty skeleton package for experienced developers (`open-dxp/skeleton`).
docker run -u `id -u`:`id -g` --rm -v `pwd`:/var/www/html opendxp/opendxp:php8.3-latest composer create-project open-dxp/skeleton my-project
```

2. Go to your new project
`cd my-project/`

3. Part of the new project is a docker compose file
    * Run `` echo `id -u`:`id -g` `` to retrieve your local user and group id
    * Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file in an editor, uncomment all the `user: '1000:1000'` lines and update the ids if necessary
    * Start the needed services with `docker compose up -d`

4. Install OpenDXP and initialize the DB
    `docker compose exec php vendor/bin/opendxp-install --mysql-host-socket=db --mysql-username=opendxp --mysql-password=opendxp --mysql-database=opendxp` (for demo package the installation can take a while)

If you choose to install backend search (which is installed by default), you must also adapt the [supervisor configuration](https://github.com/open-dxp/skeleton/blob/1.x/.docker/supervisord.conf#LL5C39-L5C90) and add the `opendxp_search_backend_message` receiver to build up the search index. 


:::

5. :heavy_check_mark: DONE - You can now visit your OpenDXP instance:
    * The frontend: [localhost](http://localhost)
    * The admin interface, using the credentials you have chosen above:
      [Admin interface](http://localhost/admin)


## Caching
Make sure to use any sort of [caching](../../19_Development_Tools_and_Details/09_Cache/) to improve performance. We recommend Redis cache storage.

## Additional Information & Help

If you would like to know more about the installation process or if you are having problems getting OpenDXP up and running, visit the [Installation Guide](../../23_Installation_and_Upgrade/README.md) section.

## Automating the Installation Process
